# LoginTest

This project includes automated testing for the login features of the "Germany is Calling" web application. The tests address multiple scenarios, such as both successful and failed login attempts, the management of empty fields, and the system's reactions to invalid inputs.

#Test Scenarios involve assessing various login outcomes.

1. Successful Login confirms that users can access their accounts using valid credentials and are directed to the appropriate landing page.

2. Unsuccessful Login ensures that a suitable error message appears when invalid credentials are entered.

3. Single Data Input examines the login procedure with a valid email but an empty password, verifying that a relevant error message is presented.

4. Blank Input tests the application's behavior when both the email and password fields are unfilled, ensuring that error messages for each field are displayed.
